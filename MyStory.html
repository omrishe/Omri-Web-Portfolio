          hello my name is Omri Shema, a computer science student passionate
          about tackling challenges with creativity and a strong technical skill
          set. <br />
          Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in programming languages like
          SQL, Java, C#, Python, and Kotlin, and gained a solid foundation in
          object-oriented programming, algorithms, machine learning, and data
          analysis. <br />
          My technical journey started during my service in the IDF, where I
          completed a practical engineering studies, focusing on
          microprocessor-based circuits and programming. <br />
          I’ve worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills,
          including: <br />
          Building a machine learning and crawling project to predict population
          growth. <br />
          Designing a C# WinForms game.<br />
          Developing an automatic watering system using sensors and
          microprocessors.<br />
          Creating an Android app for managing soccer teams.<br />
          Currently, I work as a helpdesk and computer operator, where I thrive
          under pressure while ensuring smooth operations of user devices and
          managing users with Active Directory. My role demands creativity and
          adaptability, both of which I bring to the table every day. I’m fluent
          in English and a native Hebrew speaker, and I’m always excited to
          apply my technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and
          dedication to achieving impactful results.
